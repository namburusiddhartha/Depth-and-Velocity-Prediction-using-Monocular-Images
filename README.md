# Depth-and-Velocity-Prediction-using-Monocular-Images

## Plase navigate to modified Monoflex for running Monoflex.

This part is largely dervied from Monoflex repository. 

Three approaches are evaluated instead on decoupled representation of cars.

## Please navigate to the AB3MOT to track and predict velocity after Monoflex.

This part is largely derived from AB3MOT official repository.

Modified Monoflex results are fed into it.

## Please navigate to slowfast for depth and velocity regression using MViT

This part is derived from an older commit of slowfast, head is modified to regress for depth and velocity.

### Please refer to the report for more details.
